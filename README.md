- 👋 Hi, I’m @socratezzzAcademy
- 👀 I’m interested in creating courses and training for anyone who is interested in learning the cutting-edge world of development in the world of AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning myself, as I have assumed the running of this program/project, so, it does not leave me much time. However, I am just as eager to be hands-on accumulate new skills, and brush up on what I have used in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with those who are interested in spreading the knowledge and creating a fulfilling career. The company (startup) that I have founded and run is independent, although, through finance and resources, we are supporting it to get it off the ground and running. It will require that support, for an unforeseeable length of time in the future. But, we are determined to see it succeed. However, the academy isn't and never was to create another line of revenue. It was truly meant to be an independent self-sustaining training facility, powered and driven by the community that uses it and works in it. I know these days, this sort of vision comes with a hook or a catch and it is hard to believe the sincerity of people involved. I am not asking you to believe what I say. But, maybe believe what we do in action, and join us. We need our entire population to begin to contribute in whatever way we each can.
- So this is a self-supported program. It is a vision I have had for a long time, and will do everything we can here to see it through, and will put into whatever it requires and we have and can afford to help it along. Education really was not meant to be a for-profit venture The one purpose we all have in common on this earth is to pass on the knowledge we gain throughout our lives. That is our true legacy. So, business on one side and this calling on the other.
