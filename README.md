- 👋 Hi, I’m @socratezzzAcademy
- 👀 I’m interested in creating courses and training for anyone who is interested in learning the cutting-edge world of development in the world of AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning myself, as I have assumed the running of this program/project, so, it does not leave me much time. However, I am just as eager to be hands-on accumulate new skills, and brush up on what I have used in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with those who are interested in spreading the knowledge and creating a fulfilling career. The company (startup) I run makes or doesn't make revenue in other areas, such as services for B2B.
- So this is a self-supported program. I will put into whatever I have and can afford. Education really was not meant to be a for-profit venture The one purpose we all have in common on this earth is to pass on the knowledge we gain throughout our lives. That is our true legacy. So, business on one side and this calling on the other.
